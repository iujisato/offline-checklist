notes for the complete readme


- make sure to use node 18 (theres a bug with realm and node 19 atm)
- make sure to run in debug mode (HTTP traffic not allowed on release builds for
 android, iOS is working as expected because I've added a domain exception for
bovcontrol)
- run cp .env.example .env (if this was a real application .env.example would not
be populated)
